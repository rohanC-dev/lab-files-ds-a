/**
 *  The functions in this module implement a Stack data structure
 *  of integers.  (Note that chars are also integers so this
 *  integer Stack can be used for chars as well.)
 *
 *  NOTE: the stack is implemented as a fixed size array (size = 100).
 *  Consequently, no more than 100 integers can be pushed onto
 *  the Stack at any given time.
 */

// Implementation hints:
//   The 3 functions--push, pop and isEmpty--share information
//   about the array used to implement the stack and the index
//   of the "top" of the stack.
//
//   You may want to make these variables global...
//   ...but that would
//   be a mistake (because anyone using the module would have
//   to ensure that they did not use global variables with the
//   same names).
//
//   An alternative in C is a "static global".
//   If a global variable is qualified as "static", it is global only
//   within the source code file where it is declared.
//   In parituclar, it cannot conflict with any other global variable.
//
//  RECOMMENDATION:
//   Uncomment the following 2 lines and use these static globals!
