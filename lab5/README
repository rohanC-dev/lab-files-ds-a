***ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS***
 Question 1:
     Which hash table collision resolution method did you use
     (eg. chaining or open addressing)? Explain your choice
     briefly (less than 25 words).
 YOUR ANSWER:
 
 I used open addressing with linear probing. So I would first map the key directly to its corresponding 
index and if there was a collision, I increment the index by one and store it there.
 
 
 
 Question 2:
       Which hash function (division or multiplication) did you use?
       How did you convert a string into a number?
 YOUR ANSWER:

 I used the djb2 hash function. For converting a string to integer, I just used standard ASCII values.
 
 
 Question 3:
       Another legal XML tag not used in this lab is the
       stand-alone tag.  This kind of tag
       combines both a start-tag and end-tag in one.
       It is identified with a '/' (slash) preceding the
       final >.  (For example, the <foo/>
       is a stand-alone tag that is self balancing.
       
       Describe briefly how
       you would modify Part 3 to allow this kind of tag.
       
 YOUR ANSWER:

I would look for the ">" and if the character before "/", I would add it to the hastable.
