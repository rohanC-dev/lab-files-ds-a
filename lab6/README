Everything works as intented.

Just some remarks:

-When you input numbers you have to press CTRL+D to get the last input for some reason, I'm not sure why.

-Also I used math.h library in this project for the intHeap.c, I compile it with adding the -lm.

commands I use to compile:

gcc -g -Wall -lm -c -o main.o main.c
gcc -g -Wall -lm -c -o intHeap.o intHeap.c
gcc -g -Wall -lm -c -o intStack.o intStack.c
gcc -g -Wall -lm -o heap main.o intHeap.o intStack.o

-To input numbers to add to Heap, when I made it I input them in one line (i.e., 30 15 8 10 16 20 50),
I think it works if you enter in sepearete lines too but that is how I did it.
