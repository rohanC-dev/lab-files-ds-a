Both insertion sort and merge sort work.

Analysis:

Insertion Sort:

Insertion sort has complexity of O(n^2) for worst case, O(n) for best case, and in between O(n^2) and O(n) for average case.

Best case: 
	Comparisons: n-1
	Swaps: 0
	Copy operations: 2n
Average Case:
	Comparisons: n(n-1)/2
	Swaps: n-3
	Copy operations: 2n
Worst Case:
	Comparisons: n(n-1)/2
	Swaps: n(n-1)/2
	Copy operations: 2n




Merge Sort:

Merge sort has complexity of O(nlogn) for best, worst, and average case.

Best case: 
	Comparisons: (0.091n*n2) + 4.73n - 5.042) 
	Swaps: 0
	Copy operations: 0
Average Case:
	Comparisons: (0.091n*n2) + 4.73n - 5.042) 
	Swaps: 0
	Copy operations: 0
Worst Case:
	Comparisons: (0.091n*n2) + 4.73n - 5.042) 
	Swaps: 0
	Copy operations: 0
